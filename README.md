Spellchecker
============
Simple spellchecker algorithms implemented in Rust.

Levenshtein distance algorithm (blazingly slow ðŸš€)
--------------------------------------------------
Never meant to be used by computers so it's recursive nature is very ineffective and slow.

Wagner-Fisher distance algorithm 
---------------------------------
Much more effective, using matrices.

Usage (Try it for yourself)
===========================
You can run the program and put the sentence, you want to correct, as argument like this

```bash
$ cargo run Helo mom, I luve you!
```
then the program will go word by word and if it detects an unknown word it will printed it out

```bash
Helo mom, I luve you!
^^^^ unknown word, maybe try
  helo -> hell
  helo -> held
  helo -> hero
  helo -> hello
```
