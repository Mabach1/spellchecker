Spellchecker
============
Simple spellchecker algorithms implemented in Rust.

Levenshtein distance algorithm (blazingly slow ðŸš€)
--------------------------------------------------
Never meant to be used by computers so it's recursive nature is very ineffective and slow.

Wagner-Fisher distance algorithm 
---------------------------------
Much more effective, using matrices.
